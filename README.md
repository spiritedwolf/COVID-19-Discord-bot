# COVID-19-Discord-bot
I made a simple Discord bot which fetches and provides you current  COVID-19 case's summary around the globe.
This being my first ever bot, I never knew making one was this much fun.

Open the covid19_discordbot.py in any editor and enter the token value in TOKEN variable.
```
TOKEN = "<Give your bot token>"
```
